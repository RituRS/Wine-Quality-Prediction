# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Predicting the quality of wine based on various attributes using machine learning.

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on a dataset of various attributes, such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and more. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify wine quality.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RituRS/wine-quality-prediction.git

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the quality of wines using machine learning techniques. Wine quality assessment is a valuable task in the wine industry, as it can help vintners and sommeliers enhance the quality of their products.

In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze various attributes of wine samples and predict their quality. The dataset used in this project contains information about red and white wine samples, including properties such as acidity, pH levels, alcohol content, and more. By building predictive models, we aim to provide valuable insights into what makes a high-quality wine.
